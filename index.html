                    <p>Hello! I'm Harshana Karunarathne, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Kelaniya,
                       following my education at Royal College Colombo. I have a deep passion for gaming and coding, finding joy in both the creativity
                        of game development and the logical challenges of programming. When I'm not immersed in technology, you can often find me on the
                         basketball court, where I enjoy playing and staying active. Through this blog, I aim to share my experiences, insights, and adventures 
                         in the world of technology, gaming, and beyond</p>

                            <p>I have a deep interest in philosophy. I am fascinated by the profound questions about existence, knowledge, and ethics that 
                                philosophy explores. This discipline challenges me to think critically and consider different perspectives, enriching my
                                 understanding of the world and informing my approach to technology and data. Through philosophy, I find inspiration to tackle 
                                 complex problems with a thoughtful and analytical mindset.
